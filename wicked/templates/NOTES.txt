This chart is considered beta, and has been tested with a few deployments
in production, but that said there may still be corner cases which have not
yet been tested and which may not lead to the intended behavior of the
Chart.

If you find any bugs, please file an issue at

    https://github.com/Haufe-Lexware/wicked.haufe.io

For a guide of which values can and possibly should be overridden from the
values.yaml file, please refer to the documentation of this Helm chart at

Point the FQDNs

* {{ .Values.ingress.portalHost }}
* {{ .Values.ingress.apiHost }}

to the IP address of the ingress controller('s load balancer). In case you
are using Let's Encrypt (`kube-lego`) annotations, you should have done this
beforehand to make sure the retrieval of certificates can succeed.
