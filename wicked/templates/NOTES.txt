This is still work in progress. You can use this chart to experimentally
deploy wicked to a Kubernetes cluster. It has not yet been tested for
production purposes, and is to be considered alpha or early beta. The work
on this will continue though, and if you feel like helping out with this,
any help is definitely welcome.

If you didn't change anything in the chart configuration, point the FQDNs
"portal.local" and "api.portal.local" to the IP address of the ingress
controller('s load balancer), depending on where you deploy to.

In case you are running on minikube, point the above FQDNs to the output
of `minikube ip`.
