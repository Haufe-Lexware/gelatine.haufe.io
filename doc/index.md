# Introduction

This is the repository for the Open Source API Management system **wicked.haufe.io**, which is maintained at [Haufe-Lexware](http://www.haufe-lexware.com). For an overview of what this actually does, please see the microsite at [wicked.haufe.io](http://wicked.haufe.io). The information on these pages is rather technical and deals with the details of

* Deploying an API Portal into production
* Configuring the APIs and the API Gateway
* Authentication of Portal Users and the configuration thereof
* Setting up a development environment for your API Portal
* Developing the Portal itself (contributing)
