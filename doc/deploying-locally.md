# Deploying an API Portal locally

In order to deploy an API portal locally on your development machine, you may follow these steps.

## Create a configuration

Make sure you have created a configuration repository and/or cloned the repository to your local machine. If you cloned it, place a `deploy.envkey` file in the `static` directory, containing the deployment key (`PORTAL_CONFIG_KEY`). This key was created the first time you created your repository; you should have kept it in a safe place (which is not git).

**See also**:

* [Creating a Portal Configuration](creating-a-portal-configuration.md)

Make sure a `portal-kickstarter` is running at [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333) (described in detail in the above document):

```bash
$ cd /path/to/repository
$ # For Windows and Mac OS X:
$ docker run -it --rm -v `pwd`:/var/portal-api -p 3333:3333 haufelexware/wicked.portal-kickstarter
$ # For Linux:
$ $ docker run -it --rm -v /path/to/repo:/var/portal-api -e LOCAL_UID=$(id -u) -e LOCAL_GID=$(id -g) -p 3333:3333 haufelexware/wicked.portal-kickstarter
```

## Enable env vars for portal and API hosts

Enable using environment variables for the host names you want to deploy to. To do that, open up the [IP, DB and DNS page](http://localhost:3333/ipconfig) in the kickstarter. Click the two checkboxes depicting that:

![Env vars for hosts](images/deploy-hosts-envvars.png)

Hit "Save" to save the configuration. Now you will be able to see that there are two new environment variables.

## Create a `localdev` environment

Within the kickstarter, go to the [Environments Page](http://localhost:3333/envs) and create a new Environment called `localdev` (you may also choose any other name, just NOT `localhost`, see [setting up a development environment](development-environment.md); `localhost` is a special name which triggers some special behaviour):

![Create localdev](images/deploy-env-localdev.png)

Open up that environment and override the two hosts environment variables we defined above:

![Override hosts envvars](images/deploy-env-override-hosts.png)

Use the mentioned values:

* `portal.local` for the Portal host
* `api.portal.local` for the API host

## Create `/etc/hosts` entries

In case you haven't yet followed the ["Getting Started" instructions](http://wicked.haufe.io/gettingstarted.html), you will need to create local hosts entries for these new host names:

```
127.0.0.1   portal.local
127.0.0.1   api.portal.local
```

This has to added (most probably using `sudo`) to `/etc/hosts` on Mac OS X and Linux, or to `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` on Windows. Make sure pinging these names work. 

## Create a `docker-compose.yml` file

Go to the [Deployment Page](http://localhost:3333/deploy) in the Kickstarter; if you don't have a `docker-compose.yml` in your base configuration directory, it will look like this:

![Deployment Config](images/deploy-config.png)

Hit the "Save" button, and two files will be created:

* `docker-compose.yml`
* `static/Dockerfile`

Inside the `docker-compose.yml` file, the `static/Dockerfile` is referenced; see also the [deployment architecture](deployment-architecture.md) for a picture of how the containers work together. The `static/Dockerfile` is used to build the "Static Configuration Container".

## Create self-signed certificates

To test things, you will also need SSL certificates. The kickstarter can assist you in creating these at [localhost:3333/ssl](http://localhost:3333/ssl):

![SSL Helper](images/deploy-ssl-helper.png)

Hit the "Create Certificates" button; some files will be created in the `certs` directory underneath your base configuration repository. **Note**: This directory must never be checked in to source control, as the shell scripts contain the `PORTAL_CONFIG_KEY` which is used to deploy and manage the API Portal.

## Deploy your API Portal to your local `docker` host

Issue the following commands into a bash shell:

```
$ cd /path/to/repo # Change this to point to your configuration repo
$ pushd certs && source ./localdev.sh && popd # Set some environment vars
$ docker-compose up -d
```

After `docker-compose` has finished, you should be able to open your API Portal from [`https://portal.local`](https://portal.local).

To take down the API Portal again, issue the following command:

```
$ docker-compose down
```

Please note that this will also **delete all local data**, such as test applications you have registered, users names you have create and so on.

## Deployment Architecture locally

The local deployment does not get the static configuration from a git repository (which is the recommended way of getting it inside the portal API), but rather uses the data-only container approach as described in [deployment architecture](deployment-architecture.md).

When taking this configuration to production, it is highly advisable to change the way the static configuration is injected into the portal API container to the git clone approach.
